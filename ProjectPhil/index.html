	            <h3>About The Defender Foundation</h3>
	            <p>The Defender Foundation is a non-profit organization that brings both activism and action to the struggling battle to stop Human trafficking. Our Shield Teams set up shelters and safe houses and risk their lives on dangerous rescue missions to bring these women and children out of bondage and onto the path of freedom.  We are currently taking our missions overseas to the hub of human trafficking…. <br/><br/>

	            The Philippines.  The average age of a trafficked girl is 13 and she has a life expectancy of two to four years after she is deceived, kidnapped or forced into prostitution <br/><br/>

	            These young women who are not kidnapped, show up to a fake job interviews and are blackmailed into the sex trade and then, within the blink of an eye, an entire human life is deleted. We’re not here to simply raise more awareness; raising awareness about this issue is simply not enough. The Defender Foundation exists to give people an opportunity to DO something about this insidious form of modern-day slavery.  <br/><br/>

	            The men who traffick these women are not petty criminals, they are organized well armed, trained, and are very dangerous.  which in turn makes rescue operations and state of the art equipment very costly. Our goals are to build a shelter, and to rescue and rehabilitate as many women and children as possible.

	            <br/><br/>

	            By donating to Misson Philippines you are not only saving girls, you are giving them the chance that they never had, a shot at life. We are an organization of common men and women with an uncommon desire to help people.  Help us win this fight against evil and prove to them that someone still thinks that they matter.</p>
