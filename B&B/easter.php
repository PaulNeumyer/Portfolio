    <h3>Easter Bank Holiday&rsquo;s 2013</h3>
    <p>
        Come to the Sailing Village of Bosham just outside on the the Historic City of Chichester on the West Sussex Coast.
        <br /><br />
        Bosham is steeped in history being the 'Seat of Kings' before that Conquerer chap turned up.
        <br /><br />
        We have miles of Sussex coast line and South Downs paths to explore by foot or by bike.
        <br /><br />
        If you're feeling less energetic and needing to de-stress, unwind and just want to 'chillax' in luxury surroundings and super comfy beds this Easter then click Availabity and Prices and start looking forward to a well earned break.
        <br /><br />
        Eat breakfast looking over the garden, or maybe in the garden and your days exploring with the spring sun on your face and your evenings in a local country hostelry before returning to 'the best nights sleep'.
