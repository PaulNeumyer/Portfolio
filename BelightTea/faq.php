        <h2>S/H and Returns</h2>
        <a id="1" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>How much is shipping? Where does it ship from and how long does it take?</li>
        <p>
            Shipping is included in the price. The tea is shipped from Phoenix, Arizona, via USPS, and usually takes 3-7 days to arrive. If you require rush shipping, please contact us at the time of your order so we can adjust the rate accordingly.
        </p>

        <a id="2" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>What are your handling fees and processing times?</li>
        <p>
            There are no handling fees. Processing time is typically 1-2 business days.
        </p>

        <a id="3" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>What is your return policy?</li>
        <p>
            If for any reason you are unsatisfied with the tea, return the unopened bags to us and <b>we’ll issue a refund</b>.
        </p>

        <a id="4" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>Can I buy your tea in stores?</li>
        <p>
            To ensure the quality of the product, Belight is only available online. In the future, it may be offered at a few select retail points. To try Belight, buy it online right now.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Tea</h2>

        <a id="5" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>What is in the Tea?</li>
        <p>
            Pu-erh (a fermented dark tea), Hemp Seeds, Cassia Seeds, Gynostemma, Sacred Lotus Leaf, and Chinese Hawthorn fruit. And nothing else!
        </p>

        <a id="6" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>Where does the Tea come from?</li>
        <p>
            The Pu-erh tea is sourced from the remote highlands of Yunnan province in western China. The herbs come from the purest Chinese herbal gardens, which specialize in producing medicinal-grade herbs for traditional Chinese medicine doctors.
            <br /><br />
            After blending and packaging, it is shipped direct to you from our warehouse in Phoenix, Arizona.
        </p>

        <a id="7" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>What about the hemp seeds in tea, should I be concerned about THC?</li>
        <p>
            Hemp seeds are naturally free of THC. To comply with applicable laws and to prevent any misuse, they are sterilized before packaging, which renders them incapable of germination.
            <br /><br />
            In food products, hemp seeds are rich in essential fatty acids (EFAs), iron, protein, fiber, and Vitamin E. However, in tea they serve a different purpose: to moisten and loosen bowels.
        </p>

        <a id="8" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>If this tea has laxative qualities, isn’t it an OTC drug?</li>
        <p>
            No; it is a food, specifically a beverage—like prune juice in its cleansing properties, but better tasting and lower in calories!  And besides, most people don’t even notice a laxative effect.
        </p>

        <a id="9" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>If this tea aids digestion, isn’t it a dietary supplement?</li>
        <p>
            No; it is a food, a beverage. Its digestive and calming benefits are similar to chamomile tea, which Europeans have enjoyed after dinner for decades. Its weight loss properties are somewhat similar to those of green tea.
        </p>

        <h2>Drinking the Tea</h2>

        <a id="10" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>How should I drink the tea?</li>
        <p>
            Just the way it is! Unlike coffee or black tea, Belight doesn’t need sugar or milk to make it palatable.  Belight tea is inherently rich in flavor. The combination of pu-erh tea and added herbs give our blend a natural and slightly sweet, earthy taste.
            <br/><br/> 
            Add hot water (between 195-210*F) to a tea cup, then drop the tea bag in. Steep for 2-3 minutes; remove the bag and save for the next brewing.
            <br/><br/> 
            Allow tea to cool slightly and enjoy!
            <br/><br/> 
            You can also use ice cubes to cool Belight down for a refreshing sugar-free summer drink!
        </p>

        <a id="11" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>How much tea should I drink?</li>
        <p>
            We recommend starting with one bag per day. Most people can get 2-3 cups from each bag of tea.
            <br /><br />
            It is best to drink the tea close to your heaviest meal, but at least 10 minutes before or after. With 12 bags in each box, you should have enough for just about 2 weeks.
            <br /><br />
            If you feel comfortable, and want a stronger effect or flavor, you can drink two bags per day or double up the tea bags.
        </p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

        <a id="12" class="bookmark"></a>
        <li>Where did the name come from?</li>
        <p>
            Belight is a play on delight, conveying the sense of lightness you’ll feel from drinking the tea. Adding the verb ‘Be’ implies activeness and emphasizes how you’ll become lighter through drinking Belight.
        </p>
