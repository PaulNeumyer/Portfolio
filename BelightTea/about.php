    <h1>Why Belight</h1>

    <h2>Effects</h2>

    <p>
        If you’ve tried other slimming teas, you probably felt like you were flushed out while having your body stripped of vitamins and minerals.  Then, when you stopped drinking the tea, you felt plugged up like a hose filled with rocks.
        <br /><br />
        Belight is different. It doesn’t strip your digestive tract of its function and nutrients nor create a feeling of dependence on the tea just to have regular bowel function.
        <br /><br />
        Our herbs are gentle, supporting the body’s natural metabolizing, processing, and elimination systems. They help balance your whole  system and maintain digestive regularity without creating any craving or yearning; and you can easily and comfortably stop drinking it anytime.
    </p>

    <h2>Taste</h2>

    <p>
        Belight tea is inherently rich in flavor with a natural and slightly sweet taste. The warm, rich aroma and light earthy flavor, with a hint of honey, will soothe your soul as well as your body. You’ll love its luscious taste.
    </p>

    <h2>Tea Bag Design</h2>

    <p>
        Because our pu-erh blend is so rich, we wanted to show it off in the best possible packaging: boxes that look like perfume cases, pyramid tea bags that display each leaf and herb as it expands in your cup, and transparent wrappers to see all the goodness of this tea.
    </p>

    <h2>Them vs. Belight</h2>

    <p>
        Our box is so stylish that many think its actually a perfume box. This is one package you’ll actually dare to keep on your desk and not be embarrassed by.
