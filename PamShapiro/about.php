                Pam Shapiro started her photography career in the Big Apple of New York City. &quot;Living and working in New York&rsquo;s &lsquo;Photo District&rsquo; was fantastic!&quot; Although it all started there, Pam took her skills and vision with her no matter where she resided.

                After 10 successful years with her studio in New York City, Pam and her family moved to New Jersey where, again, Pam had a studio for 10 years.

                Pam Shapiro and her services currently reside in the town of Jupiter in Palm Beach County, Florida. As her daughters move on through college Pam continues to flourish with her passion for photography. Pam thrives on the spirit of location photography, as well as mastering the controlled environment of a studio setting.
