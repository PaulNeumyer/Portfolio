						<strong>As you can see above, there was a big 
						improvement in the results that I am grateful for</strong>. </p>
						<p >
						<span class="auto-style6">This improvement in just one 
						year</span> was SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT event in my 
						life because it offered me the choice of going to IIT or 
						BITS and eventually going to USA, getting big success 
						there, and returning to India to confidently start our 
						institute.</p>
						<p >
						The next year, in the first semester in BITS, Pilani, my 
						CGPA was 10.00 (all A's):</p>
						<p class="auto-style31" >
						<img alt="" height="500" src="images/bits/4a-1.png" width="497"></p>
						<p >
						In the 2nd year in Pilani, in a course called "Report 
						Writing" my topic was "How to Get High Marks at BITS 
						Pilani".</p>
						<p >
						Here,
						I got all A's again:</p>
						<p class="auto-style31" >
						<img alt="" height="486" src="images/bits/4As-2.png" width="513"></p>
						<p >
						&nbsp;</p>
						<h2 >
						But, When I Made A Stupid Mistake<br>During a Semester, <br>
						I Got<span class="auto-style13"> 1 B Grade</span> and
						<span class="auto-style13">4 C Grades</span></h2>
						<p >
						But, then I made a STUPID mistake and see what happened 
						to my exam results.</p>
						<p >
						<strong><span class="auto-style14">The mistake was in my 
						thinking.</span></strong> It was not like I started 
						drinking or stopped attending classes or stopped 
						studying. It was just an "erroneous or mistaken thought" 
						that caused the change is results from most As to most 
						Cs.</p>
						<p >
						<span class="auto-style6">IMPORTANT for You to Consider</span>: Is there at 
						least a small chance that even you may be making a similar 
						mistake without knowing about it? What would be the 
						impact of such a stupid mistake?</p>
						<p >
						Why am I showing you my failure and stupid mistake? 
						Because I want you to get success and so I want to make 
						sure you don't make such mistakes.</p>
						<p >
						When you get the course, you'll know what the mistake 
						was and will never make the mistake yourself. But, 
						you'll also learn about other stupid mistakes that even 
						smart students make, and I'll show you how to avoid such 
						mistakes.</p>

						Finally, I went to USA and worked at many companies in 
						Silicon Valley and elsewhere including Intel Corporation 
						and also wrote books on computers published 
						in USA and one became a best-seller world wide (I even saw it 
						in a bookshop in Sydney when I visited Australia).</p>

						<h1 >Is there a single most important<br>secret of success 
						that<br><span class="auto-style3">most people don't even 
						know about</span></h1>
						<h2 >Answer: Finding the <span class="auto-style14">right 
						thing to focus on</span> </h2>
						<p>Let me tell you a story.</p>
						<p>Two main groups in America were competing to build a 
						"flying machine".</p>
						<p>Wright brothers vs. Alexander Graham Bell's group of 
						inventors and rich investors. </p>
						<p>While the others focused on the engine, 
						the&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;brothers built the plane as a glider first, 
						so the aero-dynamic design was first done. </p>
						<p>What they learnt was that the wings were more 
						important than the engine.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
							<div>
								<p class="auto-style32"><strong>Wings determine:</strong> 
								Can the plane fly at all?</p>
							</div>
							</li>
							<li>
							<div>
								<p class="auto-style32"><strong>Engine 
								determines:</strong> How fast can it run or fly?</p>
							</div>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<div>
							<p>Their first U.S. patent number 821393, did not claim 
							invention of a flying machine, but rather, the 
							invention of a system of aerodynamic control that 
							manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.</p>
							<h2>My personal experience ...</h2>
							<p>Over the past 21 years of helping students, what 
							has become more and more clear to me is that while 
							students think that they have "time management 
							problem" or 
							"course material&nbsp;problem" or "expert teacher 
							problem", the truth is that they 
							have a problem of "<strong><span class="auto-style14">memory 
							power &amp; sharp concentration during learning for the 
							first time and revision as well as during the exam</span></strong>". </p>
							<p>And, that is what you master when you join my course Mind Power Exam 
							Maximizer.</p>

							<img alt="" height="50" src="images/number1.gif" width="50"><br> </b></span>What if you can
							discover the <span class="auto-style10">number 1 
							secret</span> <br>of memory power and sharp concentration</h2>
							<p>
							Imagine what you&#39;ll gain if you can discover this 
							secret.</p>
						<p>
							Now, let me teach it to you right now. </p>
						<p>
							Listen carefully. If you get nothing else from me, 
							just understand this one concept and you&#39;ll benefit.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Here is the secret for you</strong>:
							Whatever you see, hear or feel is processed by the 
							brain and most goes into short-term memory. Whatever 
							is uniquely different or whatever you revise again 
							and again and again goes into long-term memory.<br></p>
						<p>
						The memory decreases sharply after initial learning.</p>
						  <p>Sadly, psychologists proved that the average students <b>
							forget 82% of what they study...</b> in the 
							first 24 hours! Meaning you won't remember even 
							one-fifth of what you just studied.</p>
						  <p>And it gets worse: after one month, you'll only 
							remember 5%. <b>At most. </b></p>
							<p>
							Most students are never taught (by teachers / 
							coaching) how to revise many times systematically, and so 
							a lot of their 
							hard work is wasted.</p>
						  <p>There's a better way. And that's found on page 90 
						  of my course <strong>Mind Power Study Techniques</strong>. 
							Go right to that page, and spend just 15 
							minutes and begin putting this &quot;mind power&quot; technique to 
							use. </p>
						<p>Only very few teachers and coaching classes now teach 
						a few of my methods.</p>
						  
						<p>In your opinion do you feel that if you can revise 
						systematically to boost your memory and increase your 
						concentration, you 
						can be sure of getting more marks and higher rank?</p>

<ul>
							<li>
							<p>I got NTSE 
									scholarship (NCERT) and 5th 
									rank in Raj High School Board. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p>Did 
									B.E. from BITS Pilani and 
									M.Tech. from IIT
									Kharagpur.</p>
							</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>I worked as a Software Engineer at Intel 
								Corporation in California USA and at several 
								other companies before returning to India to 
								start our institute to help students. 
								</li>
								<li>In USA, I was member of <i>Society of Accelerated Learning and Teaching</i> 
								and learnt <i>Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP)</i>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>For over 20 years, I have 
									been helping students like you.</strong> The real 
									secret why my students make big improvements 
									so quickly is that I do my own research and 
									also get training from the best in the world. </p>

						<h1>Developed by Research and <br>Proven by Results ...</h1>
						  <p>Do you know that I quit USA in 1991 and created 
						  this course. Over the 20 years, from all my research 
						  and hard work, I have not written many new books and 
						  courses, but improved this course year after year.</p>
						<h2>	
						Saves your 
						time</h2>
						<p>
						I know that 
						<b>you are already overloaded with too much course 
						material</b>, so this course is designed for you to learn quickly (some techniques / concepts 
						take under just 5 minutes to learn) and begin to use them 
						immediately and save time.</p>
						
				
							
							
						<h2>Helps 
						you get ahead of other students</h2>
						<p>Because most students don't even know of these 
						powerful techniques, those who use them (and you can) 
						have a big advantage in competitions.</p>
						<h2>
							<span class="auto-style33">Because</span><span class="auto-style13"> the Subject Coaching is 
							<br>No Longer Enough for Success in the Tough 
							Exams,</span> <br><span class="auto-style3">You Have to Do 
							Something Different and Unique</span></h2>
	<p><b>Long back when I took the IIT-JEE exam</b>, the competition was tough. 
	Fortunately, I had joined coaching and because very few people joined 
	coaching, it was enough to help me get rank 1102.</p>

<p>Just joining the &quot;subject coaching&quot; is not enough and you have to do more to get 
ahead of others.</p>
						<p>So, you have to do something more, something 
						different, something unique like using my course.</p>
        
						
		
      
 
						<h2>
							I Lost a Big Chance Because ...</h2>
							<p>
							For my IIT entrance, I wanted to order the best 
							postal course and my parents could afford it but I 
							wasn't sure if it could certainly get 
							me 
							admission to IIT. </p>
						<p>
							So, after thinking for 3 months, I 
							asked my parents who immediately said &quot;yes&quot;. </p>
						<p>
							Then I ordered the course, which was very good and helped me get 
							rank 1102. I went to IIT Kanpur for counseling, but 
							my rank was not high enough to get Electronics 
							Engineering in IIT Kanpur, 
							so I joined BITS, Pilani. </p>
						<p>
							I lost a big chance because I could not decide and waited.
							You should not lose any chance. Order today if your 
							exam is really important to you.</p>
						<p>
							I am so grateful that I have this opportunity to 
							help you. </p>
						  <h2><img src="images/Line-1.png" alt="" height="51" width="698" border="0" />My 
						  course is totally different<br>in 3 ways </h2>
