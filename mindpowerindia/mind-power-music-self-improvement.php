						Our Student Set All India Memory Power Record and<br />
        Was Selected in Administrative Services</h2>
        <p><img src="images/boy_color.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="141" height="169" class="floatright"/>Our student Rajiv Chaudhary,
        from Palampur in Himachal Pradesh, set a memory record
        (Limca Book of Records). In interviews to many newspapers
        he said, "The secret of my newly developed memory are
        <i>Mind Power Music</i> ... and <i>Mind Power Study
        Techniques</i> course from Udaipur."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before joining our course, he
        was an average student and scored only 52.25 % in High
        School Exam.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rajiv went on to achieve his

        <h2><img src="images/Line-1.png" alt="" height="51" width="698" border="0" /><br>What is Mind Power Music<br />
        and How It Works</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dr Anil Bapna's Mind Power
        Music</i> has a soothing, natural, river-like music, so it
        helps you to relax.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so relaxing that at
        times, you may not even notice that the music is
        playing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not like film music. It
        is not like Indian or western classical music. It is a new
        type of music based on science.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It relaxes you and then
        programs your mind for success or the desired
        self-improvement by using subliminal messages, which are
        hidden from or below the level of your conscious mind. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But,
        your sub-conscious mind can hear these messages and accept
        them to enable changes and to empower you for more
        success.</p>
        <h3>What is Mind Programming</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mind is like a computer. A
        computer can be programmed for accounting or writing
        letters. Similarly your mind can be programmed to change
        your behavior for success, and it is called mind
        programming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of us has conscious mind
        and sub-conscious mind. You are reading this article by
        your choice&nbsp; - using your conscious mind. Working of
        your heart or flow of blood in your body is controlled by
        your subconscious mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, your subconscious
        mind is much more powerful than your conscious mind. And,
        it determines much of your behaviour and thus your success
        of failure in life.</p>

<b>		<span class="style1">Answer:</span>		"Automatic Positive Thinking"</b></h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you heard about
        <strong>positive thinking</strong>?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People tell you to "think
        positive" but they don't show you how to think
        positive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, people tell "be
        confident", but they don't tell you how. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such people wish
        you well though their advice is meaningless because their
        advice is like "Be a millionaire". You can't just "be a
        millionaire" by thinking because to be a millionaire, you
        need money in the bank. Similarly, to be confident, you
        need confidence in the bank of your subconscious mind,
        which is in the form of beliefs and is based on your past
        experiences.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subliminal Messages
        is an effective way to put beliefs into your
        mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subliminal Messages are <span lang="en-us">
		</span>recorded in a special way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, because the process is
        automatic because you simply to listen to music and there
        is no effort at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are examples of the
        messages we use in the program <b>Better Memory and
        Concentration</b><i>: My memory is very good, I remember
        very easily, I remember permanently.</i></p>
		  <div class="box">
          	<h2>A Hypnotist Proves ...</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently Raj Bapna conducted
          a workshop for experts and owners of colleges at the
          Hotel Hyatt Regency in Mumbai, where the fee to attend
          was Rs 19,000 per person to hear me for 2 days.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the participants was
          Prof Ashok Davda of Thane. He is our old friend.
          Initially, Prof Davda, like many others who first hear of
          subliminal messages, was skeptical of our Mind Power
          Music technology and did not believe that such a thing
          could work. But being a professional hypnotist, he
          decided to check us out.</p>
          <p><i>
		  <img border="0" src="images/davdaji.gif" width="96"
          height="125" align="left" class="floatright"/></i>He simply ordered some of our Mind
          Power Music, and then what he did is really
          creative and remarkable. He hypnotized one of his
          students and played our Mind Power Music. What
          we all hear is sounds of birds, sounds of water/river and
          very relaxing special music, but no words. That is for
          people who are not hypnotized.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what Prof Davda did was
          to ask his hypnotized student, "What words do you hear".
          And to Prof Davda's utter amazement, the student heard
          positive empowering messages and spoke out what he
          heard.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being scientific by nature,
          what Prof Davda did next is also surprising. He noted
          down the words (messages) heard by the hypnotized
          student, and then traveled to Udaipur from Thane. And
          then he asked us to tell him what are the exact messaged
          used. We showed him our list. And to Prof Davda's total
          surprise, our messages matched with the student's list.
          And, that is how Prof Davda became our friend.</p>
          <h2><span class="style2">Strange But True</span>:<br />
          Beliefs are Not Just in Your Mind<br />
          They are Also in Your Body</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been discovered that
          there are about 50 to 60 chemicals taking messages from
          the brain to the body. The most well-known of these are
          called endorphins. In the past it was believed that
          endorphins were present only in the brain. But now they
          have been found in the body, carrying messages to
          practically every cell in the body.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These chemicals carry
          messages in the body about everything including thoughts,
          happiness, feelings, beliefs, etc.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us see an example. A
          person is walking in the park. He sees something like a
          snake and thinks in his mind "It is a snake." That
          message of fear goes to other parts of the brain, then to
          the spinal cord, and then to the rest of the body. In a
          very short period, the whole body knows about the danger
          and prepares itself to face the danger. The heart rate
          increases, blood pressure increases, breathing becomes
          faster. Blood is diverted from the brain to the muscles,
          the hands and the feet. As a result, the person is ready
          to "fight" or "to run away". </p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This well known phenomenon
          is called "fight-or-flight" response. Just the thought
          "snake" creates this response.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Deepak Chopra says, "To
          think is to practice brain chemistry."</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are happy or you
          believe in achieving success in whatever you are doing,
          that thought is conveyed to your whole body. Your body is
          more energetic and less tired. When someone is unhappy
          and sad, his body is slow, dull, and tired.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Mind Power Music helps
          you to build positive beliefs easily.</p>

        maximum benefit from your hard work and coaching for your
        success. No wonder, "Better Memory &amp; Concentration" is
        most loved among students.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better memory and
        concentration allows you to study and learn more in the
        same time, which makes you confident about yourself and
        helps you get ahead of others in your exams and
        competitions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the sample messages in
        this program:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>My memory is very good.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I remember very easily.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I remember permanently.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I concentrate easily on anything.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I concentrate easily and remember easily.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I remember easily whatever I read, hear, see.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I enjoy studying and remember for competitions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I remember and recall easily during exams and
            tests.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Imagine what will happen once your mind with these
        beliefs. You'll have better memory and concentration, which
        means you'll be able to study more in less time for your
        success.</p>

		  <img border="0" src=

          deep relaxation and builds new empowering beliefs in
          place of any self-limiting beliefs. You have to use it to
          believe.</p>
          <p>It uses some of the mind technologies from our mind
          machine.</p>
          <p>One of the mind technologies Genius CD uses is <b>DAPS
          (Dual Auto Peripheral Suggestions)</b>. What it means is
          that you <u>hear a different story in each ear</u> in my
          voice that makes artful use of language, neuro linguistic
          programming, Ericksonian techniques to <b>immediately
          produce measurable relaxation</b> in you while building
          positive, powerful, empowering beliefs that produce
          dramatic breakthrough results for you.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>And, it <b><u>breaks your negative blocks and
          beliefs</u></b> if any, which is necessary before major
          improvements can take place for you to see and feel big
          important results.</p>
          <h3>"When you use the Genius CD, expect<br />
          to feel for yourself great results in 13
          minutes"</h3>
          <p>What's more you
          don't have to wait for weeks or months to notice the
          benefits. </p>
			<p>Most people feel the benefits on the first day
          when they use the CD in just 13 minutes. Almost all
          people notice benefits within one week. </p>
			<p>You can expect to
          quickly notice and feel for yourself all the benefits of
          the learning state and waking up a little genius inside
